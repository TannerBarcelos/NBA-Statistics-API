# NBA-Statistics-API

## About the Project
- A public API for all NBA statistical data. 
- This API exposes data from a custom source of truth built from a custom web scraper found [here](https://github.com/TannerBarcelos/NBA-Statistics-Scraper)
- This scraper populates a MySQL database with the necessary data to act as the source of truth for this API and all endpoints in this API are robust and extensible for your needs
